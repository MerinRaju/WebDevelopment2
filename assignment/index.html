<h2><i>Welcome to the Official Website of SC WATERLOO..!</i></h2>
 <p>We entered the 2014 season full of optimism, and with a newly designed logo, as both our Pro and 2nd Division teams were defending champions. However, injuries quickly made it obvious how difficult it would be to defend our titles.

The Pro team had a difficult start to the campaign, but a late push saw us make the playoffs and salvage the season, but it was still disappointing to miss out on our title defence.

The 2nd Division team made club history by finishing in the top 4 to clinch our first ever home playoff berth. The team managed to make it to the finals again.

Now, the 2015 season is in sight and there are new reasons for optimism. There will be new blood in the club and the league, and new reasons to hope.</p>
